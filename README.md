To do: Investigate the SQL database of the online travel company to gain an understanding of customer behaviour and answer questions about business decisions. 

I explored the following insights: 
•  The growth in orders made between Nov 2021 and Nov 2022 by desktop and mobile 
• Percentage increase for value by platform (November 2021 - November 2022) 
•  Difference in amount of bookings made by desktop or mobile platform in one year period  (November 2021  November 2022) 
• Increase of orders and value by platform and region 
• Percentage increase of orders and value by platform and country in the APAC region 
• The most popular destinations for travellers from Australia and South Korea in November 2021 and November 2022 
• Percentage that value made by countries added to destinations in 2022 made of total orders and total value

Key Findings:
1. The company should invest in the development of the mobile platform (app especially), but keep investing in the desktop platform:
   • The growth in users choosing mobile between November 2021 and November 2022 is significant
   • The growth in profit from mobile bookings is also significantly bigger in that period
   • It should be considered in investment plans that the desktop is still the main platform for making bookings
2. The region in which the company was the most successful in APAC:
   • Two countries in this region (Australia and South Korea), in which also the mobile platform was most popular, should be highlighted as an example
3. The offer of the Travel company could be increased by adding new destinations and removing those less popular:
   • the impact of adding new countries to the list of destinations should be measured in the future, especially for the countries with the highest growth in orders and value
